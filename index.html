            <h1>Formula 1 Drivers Are Paying More Fines Than Ever, And They’re Not Happy About It
            </h1>
            <p class="subhead">Drivers are complaining that the fines are unnecessary. The FIA says it has valid reasons
                for imposing them.
            </p>

            <p>By <a href="https://hazel-gandhi.github.io/">Hazel Gandhi</a></p>
        </div>
        <p>Formula 1’s governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, or FIA, has been taking heat from
            drivers for a few years now for its ways of penalizing them, including charging hefty monetary fines for
            seemingly small infractions.
        </p>
        <p>The FIA has a strict set of rules and penalties it imposes on drivers for various infringements, right from
            causing collisions and driving recklessly to wearing jewellery and cursing during races and press
            conferences.
        </p>
        <p>The drivers’ association is not pleased with these rules that are being imposed more frequently now than
            before. In 2024 alone, the FIA collected 260,000 euros in fines from drivers and teams, tripling their
            collection from past years.
        </p>
        <div>
            <object type="text/html" data="ai2html-output/chart-1.svg.html" width="100%" height="500px"
                style="border: none; overflow: hidden;"></object>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Several drivers, however, disagree and maintain that not all of these penalties are required. During the
                Singapore Grand Prix last year, Red Bull’s Max Verstappen was ordered by the FIA to perform an act of
                “public interest” for using expletives to describe his car in a press conference.
            </p>
            <p>Following this, the Grand Prix Drivers Association (GDPA) representing all drivers addressed the
                situation and asked to be treated like “adults” by the FIA and its President, Mohammed Ben Sulayem.
                “With regards to swearing, there is a difference between swearing intended to insult others and more
                casual swearing, such as you might use to describe bad weather, or indeed an inanimate object such as a
                Formula 1 car, or a driving situation,” the statement on Instagram read.</p>
            <p>Apart from Verstappen, other drivers too have received penalties for swearing in press conferences in the
                form of monetary fines. Charles Leclerc was fined 5,000 euros for swearing in a press conference after
                the Mexican Grand Prix last year, despite apologizing immediately.
            </p>
            <p>Other players too, have faced monetary fines for using inappropriate and sometimes offensive language.
            </p>
        </div>

            <object type="text/html" data="ai2html-output/chart-2.svg.html" width="100%" height="580px"
                style="border: none; overflow: hidden;"></object>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The FIA however, insists that these rules are important. “We have to differentiate between our sport —
                motorsport — and rap music,” Ben Sulayem told motorsport.com in a statement last year. In a later
                statement on Instagram, he revealed that the FIA is taking the drivers’ feedback into consideration and
                looking to change rules related to swearing.
            </p>
            <p>Here are some other major reasons why drivers were forced by the FIA to pay up:

                    <p>Carlos Sainz was fined €20,000 because he showed up to the
                        national anthem 5 seconds late in Suzuka. Sainz was reportedly having stomach issues which
                        caused the
                        delay in his arrival. His fine was reduced by €10,000 after a doctor verified that he had
                        stomach problems.</p>
                    <p>He addressed the fine in a press interaction and said, "I think I am the
                        biggest supporter of punctuality," and added, "...at the same time, I was 5 seconds late." He
                        ended by saying, "I don't know if I'm going to get another fine for saying this, but shit
                        happens."

                        asked Perez to continue to ensure that their other player, Max Verstappen, maintained the lead

        <p>In general, the FIA has maintained that these fines are used for good. Nikolas Tombazis, another FIA
            official
            emphasized how fines are used to strengthen the sport’s grassroots movements and make the sport more
            accessible. “...all the money is spent on what is considered to be beneficial aspects, whether it is for
            safety, for grassroots in motorsport, or sometimes other projects which are to do with road safety.” he
            told
            motorsport.com.
        </p>
        <p>Monetary fines, despite adding up to a lot, form only one part of the penalties the FIA imposes. Drivers
            and
            teams are subjected to penalties in different forms including time penalties, where extra seconds are
            added
            to their finishing time, or a position penalty, where drivers are forced to start the race from a lower
            grid
            position.
        </p>
        <p>Other penalties include monetary fines, suspension of Super Licenses, which are special licenses issued
            to F1
            drivers, or disqualification.

        <p>Drivers in general have demanded transparency in the process for imposing fines and other penalties.
            Mercedes
            driver George Russell, who is a vocal critic of the FIA’s current system, said, “For us when we were
            hearing
            from the FIA a couple of years ago, when they had the presidential elections, they were all about
            transparency.”

        <p>He added, "About where the money was going to be reinvested in terms of grassroots racing, which we are
            all
            in favour of. We just want the transparency, an understanding of what was promised from the beginning."
